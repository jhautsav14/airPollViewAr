# Enhancing Air Pollution Visualization in Augmented Reality Using Adaptive Level of Detail


## Getting Started

One of the most important environmental 
problems in the world is air pollution, which calls for efficient 
monitoring and communication systems. Through the use of 
Augmented Reality (AR), this project seeks to improve the 
visualization of air pollution statistics while providing a user-
friendly and interactive method of raising environmental 
awareness. LOD algorithms are essential for achieving 
scalable, immersive, and real-time visualization. Optimizing 
the LOD technique for the effective depiction of extensive air 
pollution datasets in augmented reality environments is the 
main goal of this project. The goal of this project is to integrate 
AR platforms with real-time air quality data so that users may 
see the different degrees of pollution in their environment. By 
simplifying or eliminating less crucial information to lessen 
the computational burden and boost efficiency, the LOD 
algorithm can be optimized to display data points with higher 
relevance more accurately. Adjusting data granularity levels
according to user proximity, viewpoint, and device capability 
will be part of the optimization process. The research will 
improve scalability and provide smoother interactions across 
many platforms, including AR headsets and smartphones, by 
increasing the algorithm‚Äôs efficiency. In the end, this 
approach will make it possible to track air pollution in a more 
accessible and insightful manner, which may inspire 
preventive steps for public health and environmental 
protection.
This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
